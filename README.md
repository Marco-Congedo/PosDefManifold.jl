**PosDefManifold** is a fairly complete package for manipulating data in the **manifold P** of **positive definite matrices**, either real or complex. The package supports **10 metrics**, two of which define **Riemannian manifolds**. 

It implements closed form expression and iterative algorithms for computing **distances**, **geodesics** and **weighted Fr√©chet means** for the supported metrics. It also computes **Graph Laplacians** and **Lapacian eigen maps** and the solution to the **Procrustes Problem** in **P**.
