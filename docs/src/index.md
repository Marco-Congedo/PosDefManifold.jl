url](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/PosDefManifold.jl/tree/master/src) for
adding the **PosDefManifold** package.

## Overview

![Figure 1](assets/Fig1.jpg)

**Riemannian geometry** studies smooth manifolds, multi-dimensional curved spaces with peculiar geometries endowed with non-Euclidean metrics. In these spaces Riemannian geometry allows the definition of **angles**, **geodesics** (shortest path between two points), **distances** between points, **centers of mass** of several points, etc.

In this package we are concerned with the manifold **P** of **positive definite matrices**, either *symmetric positive definite* or *Hermitian positive definite*.

In several fields of research such as *computer vision* and *brain-computer interface*, treating data in the **P** manifold has allowed the introduction of machine learning approaches with remarkable characteristics, such us simplicity of use, excellent classification accuracy, as demonstrated by the [winning score](http://alexandre.barachant.org/challenges/) obtained in six international data classification competitions, and the ability to operate transfer learning (Congedo et *al.*, 2017)[ðŸŽ“](@ref)).

For a formal introduction to the **P** manifold the reader is referred to Bhatia (2007)[ðŸŽ“](@ref).

For an introduction to Riemannian geometry and an overview of mathematical tools implemented in this package, see [Intro To Riemannian Geometry](introToRiemannianGeometry/index.html) in this documentation.
