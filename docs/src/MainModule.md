|:----------:|
| [LinearAlgebra](https://bit.ly/2W5Wq8W) |
| [Statistics](https://bit.ly/2Oem3li) |

Examples in some units of **PosDefManifold** also uses the `Plots` package. Take a look at this [tutorial](https://cleytonfar.github.io/posts/using-julia-for-data-science-part-03/)
for an introduction to data plotting with Julia.

The main module does not contains functions, but it declares all **constant**,
**types** and **aliases** of Julia functions used in all units.

### types

#### Metric::Enumerated type
```
@enum Metric begin
  Euclidean    =1
  invEuclidean =2
  ChoEuclidean =3
  logEuclidean =4
  LogCholesky  =5
  Fisher       =6
  logdet0      =7
  Jeffrey      =8
  VonNeumann   =9
  Wasserstein  =10
end
```

 Riemannian manipulations are defined for a given *metric* (see [metrics](@ref)).
 An instance for this type is requested as an argument in many functions
 contained in the [riemannianGeometry.jl](@ref) unit in order to specify
 the metric.

```
 ## Example
 # generate a 15x15 symmetric positive definite matrix
 P=randP(15)              
 # distance from P to the identity matrix according to the logdet0 metric
 d=distance(logdet0, P)  
```

 If you want to work consistently with a specific metric,
 you may want to declare in your script a global variable such as

    global metric=logdet0  or  global metric=Metric(Int(logdet0)),

 and then pass `metric` as argument in all your computations,
 *e.g.*, referring to the above example,

    d=distance(metric, P).

To know what is the current metric, you can get it as a string using:

    s=string(metric)

To see the list of metrics in type `Metric` use:

    instances(Metric)

### tips & tricks

#### typecasting matrices
 Several functions in **PosDefManifold** implement multiple dispatch and can handle several kinds of matrices as input, however the core functions for manipulating objects on the Riemannian manifold of positive definite matrices act by definition on positive definite matrices only.
 Those matrices must therefore be either
 *symmetric positive definite (SPD, real)* or *Hermitian positive definite (HPD, complex)*.
 Such matrices are uniformly identified in **PosDefManifold** as being of the `Hermitian` type, using the standard [LinearAlgebra](https://bit.ly/2JOiROX) package.
 The alias `ℍ` is used consistently in the code (see [aliases](@ref)).
 If the input is not flagged as `Hermitian`, the functions restricting the input to *positive definite matrices* will not be accessible.

 **Example**

    julia> using LinearAlgebra

    julia> f(S::Hermitian)=S*S'
    f (generic function with 1 method)

    julia> A=randn(3, 3)
    3×3 Array{Float64,2}:
     -0.67407  -0.344258    0.203714
     -1.06551  -0.0233796   0.975465
     -1.04727  -1.19807    -0.0219121

    julia> H=A*A' # although SPD, H is not automatically flagged as Hermitian
    3×3 Array{Float64,2}:
     0.614384  0.924991  1.11391
     0.924991  2.08738   1.12251
     1.11391   1.12251   2.53263

    julia> f(H)
    ERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Array{Float64,2})
    Closest candidates are:
      f(::Hermitian) at none:1

 If you construct a positive definite matrix and it is not flagged,
 you can do so simply by **typecasting** it, that is, passing as argument to the
 functions `Hermitian(P)` instead of just `P`. The `ℍ` alias can be
 used for short, *i.e.*, `ℍ(P)`. Continuing the example above:

    julia> f(ℍ(H))  # this way it works, equivalent to f(Hermitian(H))
    3×3 Array{Float64,2}:
     2.47388  3.74948  4.54381
     3.74948  6.4728   6.21635
     4.54381  6.21635  8.91504

 Be careful: `Hermitian(P)` will construct and Hermitian matrix from the argument.
 If the matrix argument is not symmetric (if real) or Hermitian (if complex)
 it will be made so by copying the transpose (if real) or complex conjugate
 and transpose (if complex) of a triangular part into the other.
 See [Hermitian](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.Hermitian).

 If you want to construct an [ℍVector type](@ref) from, say, two Hermitian matrices `P` and `Q`, don't write `A=[P, Q]`, but rather `A=ℍVector([P, Q])`. In fact,
 the first is seen by Julia as

    2-element Array{Hermitian{Float64,Array{Float64,2}},1},

 while the latter as

    2-element Array{Hermitian,1},

 which is the type expected in all functions taking an `ℍVector type` as argument.

 Other functions act on generic matrices (of type [Matrix](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/arrays/#Base.Matrix)). This is seen by Julia as `Array{T,2} where T`.
 Keep in mind that the functions writing on the argument matrix such as
 [`normalizeCol!`](@ref) will give an error if you pass an `Hermitian` matrix,
 since Julia does not allow writing on non-diagonal elements of those matrices.
 In this case typecast it in another object using the `Matrix` type;
 suppose `H` is `Hermitian`, you would use for example:

    julia> X=Matrix(H)
    julia> normalizeCol!(X, 1)
    julia> norm(X[:, 1])
    1.0

  Some more examples:

 - Typecasting `Adjoint` matrices:

    Matrix(X')

 - here is how to get an `Hermitian` matrix out of the
 diagonal part of an `Hermitian` matrix H:

    Hermitian(Matrix(Diagonal(H)))

 - here is how to get a `LowerTriangular` matrix out of an
 `Hermitian` matrix H:

    LowerTriangular(Matrix(H))

 For example, you can use this to pass a full inter-distance matrix to the [`laplacian`](@ref) function to obtain the Laplacian matrix.

 A useful function is [`typeofMatrix`](@ref). For example, the following line
 typecasts matrix `M` to the type of matrix `P` and put the result in `A`:

    A=typeofMatrix(P)(M)

#### Threads
Some functions in **PosDefManifold** explicitly call BLAS routines
for optimal performnce. This is reported in the help section of the
concerned functions. Most functions calls BLAS routine implicitly
via Julia. You can set the number of threads
the BLAS library should use by:

    using LinearAlgebra
    BLAS.set_num_threads(n)

where `n` is the number of threads.
By default, **PosDefManifold** reserves to BLAS
all CPU threads available on your computer (given by the output of `Sys.CPU_THREADS`)
minus the number threads used by Julia
for multi-threaded computations (given by the output of `Threads.nthreads()`).
In Windows this latter number of threads is set to hals the avaiable threads.
In Linux and OSX defaults to one and is controlled by an environment variable, i.e.,

   `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4`

See this [post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/issue-number-of-threads/14593), this [post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/customize-number-of-threads-interactively/11574/2) and julia
[doc on threads](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/parallel-computing/#Multi-Threading-(Experimental)-1).

Notice that **PosDefManifold** features many multi-threaded functions and these
may allow a gain in computation time only if Julia is instructed to use
at least two threads.
