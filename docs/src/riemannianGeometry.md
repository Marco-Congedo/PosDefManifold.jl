This is the fundamental unit of **PosDefManifold**. It contains functions
for manipulating points in the Riemannian manifold of
*Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)* or *Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD)* matrices. In Julia those are `Hermitian` matrices, see [typecasting matrices](@ref).

The functions are divided in six categories:

| Category  | Output |
|:----------:| ----------- |
| 1. [Geodesic equations](@ref) | interpolation, extrapolation,... |
| 2. [Distances](@ref) | length of geodesics |
| 3. [Graphs and Laplacians](@ref) | for spectral embedding, eigenmaps, system dynamics,...|
| 4. [Means](@ref) | mid-points of geodesics, centers of mass of several points |
| 5. [Tangent Space operations](@ref) | maps from the manifold to the tangent space and viceversa |
| 6. [Procrustes problems](@ref) | for data matching, transfer learning,...|
